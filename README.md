# AutoShots
### This is no longer required as [Shots](https://github.com/swiftlysingh/Shots) will automatically pull data from Instagram using Zapier.
I created this script to automate the deployment of my exported photographs directly to my [website](http://shots.pushpinderpalsingh.com/).

## Usage
- Add a target directory, mine is images under [Shots](https://github.com/pushpinderpalsingh/shots)
- Add a source directory (a directory that you will export your images to)
- Install dependencies using ```pip3 install -r requirements```
- Run the script using ```python3 AutShots.py```
- You can monitor the logs using AutoShots.log
- And for debain based distros, I have also made a service which will run this script automatically
